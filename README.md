## üëã Introduction

The following components will be installed in your [k3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster by default. Most are only included to get a minimum viable cluster up and running.

- [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) - GitOps operator for managing Kubernetes clusters from a Git repository
- [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/) - Load balancer for the Kubernetes control plane nodes
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) - Load balancer for Kubernetes services
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - Operator to request SSL certificates and store them as Kubernetes resources
- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) - Container networking interface for inter pod and service networking
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) - Operator to publish DNS records to Cloudflare (and other providers) based on Kubernetes ingresses
- [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) - DNS resolver that provides local DNS to your Kubernetes ingresses
    - [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) - swapping out ingress-nginx for traefik
- [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-crd/) - Kubernetes ingress controller used for a HTTP reverse proxy of Kubernetes ingresses
- [local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) - provision persistent local storage with Kubernetes

_Additional applications include [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari), [error-pages](https://github.com/tarampampam/error-pages), [echo-server](https://github.com/Ealenn/Echo-Server), [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller), [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader), and [kured](https://github.com/weaveworks/kured)_

For provisioning the following tools will be used:

- [Fedora 36 Server](https://getfedora.org/en/server/download/) - Universal operating system that supports running all kinds of home related workloads in Kubernetes and has a faster release cycle
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) - Provision Fedora Server and install k3s
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) - Provision an already existing Cloudflare domain and certain DNS records to be used with your k3s cluster

### ‚ö†Ô∏è pre-commit - check into the sops-pre-commit settings to make sure that is correct

It is advisable to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and the pre-commit hooks that come with this repository.
[sops-pre-commit](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/sops-pre-commit) will check to make sure you are not committing non-encrypted Kubernetes secrets to your repository.

1. Enable Pre-Commit

    ```sh
    task precommit:init
    ```

2. Update Pre-Commit, though it will occasionally make mistakes, so verify its results.

    ```sh
    task precommit:update

### üîê Setting up Age

üìç Here we will create a Age Private and Public key. Using [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) with [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) allows us to encrypt secrets and use them in Ansible, Terraform and Flux.

1. Create a Age Private / Public Key

    ```sh
    age-keygen -o age.agekey
    ```

2. Set up the directory for the Age key and move the Age file to it

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age
    mv age.agekey ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
    ```

3. Export the `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` variable in your `bashrc`, `zshrc` or `config.fish` and source it, e.g.

    ```sh
    export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

4. Fill out the Age public key in the `.sops.yaml` under each age key (if using different ones), **note** the public key should start with `age`...

### üìÑ Configuration

üìç The `.config.env` file contains necessary configuration that is needed by Ansible, Terraform and Flux.

1. Copy the `.config.sample.env` to `.config.env` and start filling out all the environment variables.

    **All are required** unless otherwise noted in the comments.

    ```sh
    cp .config.sample.env .config.env
    ```

2. Once that is done, verify the configuration is correct by running:

    ```sh
    task verify
    ```

3. If you do not encounter any errors run start having the script wire up the templated files and place them where they need to be.

    ```sh
    task configure
    ```

### ‚ö° Preparing Fedora Server with Ansible

üìç Here we will be running a Ansible Playbook to prepare Fedora Server for running a Kubernetes cluster.

üìç Nodes are not security hardened by default, you can do this with [dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening) or similar if it supports Fedora Server.

1. Ensure you are able to SSH into your nodes from your workstation using a private SSH key **without a passphrase**. This is how Ansible is able to connect to your remote nodes.

   [How to configure SSH key-based authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server)

2. Install the Ansible deps

    ```sh
    task ansible:init
    ```

3. Verify Ansible can view your config

    ```sh
    task ansible:list
    ```

4. Verify Ansible can ping your nodes

    ```sh
    task ansible:ping
    ```

5. Run the Fedora Server Ansible prepare playbook

    ```sh
    task ansible:prepare
    ```

6. Reboot the nodes

    ```sh
    task ansible:reboot
    ```
### ‚õµ Installing k3s with Ansible

üìç Here we will be running a Ansible Playbook to install [k3s](https://k3s.io/) with [this](https://galaxy.ansible.com/xanmanning/k3s) wonderful k3s Ansible galaxy role. After completion, Ansible will drop a `kubeconfig` in `./provision/kubeconfig` for use with interacting with your cluster with `kubectl`.

‚ò¢Ô∏è If you run into problems, you can run `task ansible:nuke` to destroy the k3s cluster and start over.

1. Verify Ansible can view your config

    ```sh
    task ansible:list
    ```

2. Verify Ansible can ping your nodes

    ```sh
    task ansible:ping
    ```

3. Install k3s with Ansible

    ```sh
    task ansible:install
    ```

4. Verify the nodes are online

    ```sh
    task cluster:nodes
    # NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
    # k8s-0          Ready    control-plane,master      4d20h   v1.21.5+k3s1
    # k8s-1          Ready    worker                    4d20h   v1.21.5+k3s1
    ```
